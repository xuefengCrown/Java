# Item 13: Minimize the accessibility of classes and members

信息封装的重要在于：解除模块之间的耦合。允许模块独立开发，测试，优化，使用，理解和修改。
Information hiding is important for many reasons, most of which stem from
the fact that it decouples the modules that comprise a system, allowing them to be
developed, tested, optimized, used, understood, and modified in isolation.

public final修饰数组，数组名不可变，但是数组内容是可以被修改的。
Note that a nonzero-length array is always mutable, so it is wrong for a class
to have a public static final array field, or an accessor that returns such a
field. If a class has such a field or accessor, clients will be able to modify the con-
tents of the array. This is a frequent source of security holes:
// Potential security hole!
public static final Thing[] VALUES = { ... };
