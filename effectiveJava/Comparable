# 12 考虑实现Comparable接口
By implementing  Comparable , you allow your class to interoperate with all of
the many generic algorithms and collection implementations that depend on this
interface.

public interface Comparable<T>{
  int compareTo(T t);
}

compareTo 方法的通用协定
The general contract of the  compareTo method is similar to that of  equals :
Compares this object with the specified object for order. Returns a negative in-
teger, zero, or a positive integer as this object is less than, equal to, or greater
than the specified object. Throws  ClassCastException if the specified ob-
ject’s type prevents it from being compared to this object.
