接口

After we cover interfaces, we move on to lambda expressions, a
concise way for expressing a block of code that can be executed at a later point
in time. We then cover a useful technical feature of Java called inner classes.

泛型 generic programming
Generic programming makes your programs easier to read and safer. We show you how to use strong
typing and remove unsightly and unsafe casts, and how to deal with the complex-
ities that arise from the need to stay compatible with older versions of Java.

collections framework 集合框架
This chapter shows you how to take advantage of the standard collections that are prebuilt for your use.

14 并发 concurrency
Chapter 14 finishes the book with a discussion of concurrency, which enables
you to program tasks to be done in parallel.

Application Programming Interface (API)


No programming language as powerful as Java is easy. You always have to dis-
tinguish between how easy it is to write toy programs and how hard it is to do
serious work. Also, consider that only seven chapters in this book discuss the Java
language. The remaining chapters of both volumes show how to put the language
to work, using the Java libraries. The Java libraries contain thousands of classes
and interfaces and tens of thousands of functions. Luckily, you do not need to
know every one of them, but you do need to know surprisingly many to use Java
for anything realistic.
