复制代码就是复制错误！
Copying code, however, means that programmers copy mistakes and the same 
fix may have to be applied to many copies.

1 functional abstraction
Another important aspect of abstraction is that you now have a single point of control over all these functions. 
If it turns out that the abstract function contains a mistake, fixing its definition suffices to fix all other definitions. 

Similarly, if you figure out how to accelerate the computations of the abstract function or how to reduce its energy consumption, 
then all functions defined in terms of this function are improved without any extra effort.


14.3 Similarities in Data Definitions
java中通过泛型来解决这个问题

Now take a close look at the following two data definitions:
; A Lon (List-of-numbers) 
; is one of:
; – '() 
; – (cons Number Lon) 
  
; A Los (List-of-String) 
; is one of: 
; – '() 
; – (cons String Los) 
------------------------------------
; A [List-of ITEM] is one of: 
; – '() 
; – (cons ITEM [List-of ITEM])
------------------------------------
