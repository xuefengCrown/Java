# 递归定义 list
; A List-of-names is one of: 
; – '()
; – (cons any List-of-names)
; interpretation a list of invitees, by last name

a self-referential definition


Fortunately a list may contain items other than atomic values; 
indeed, lists may contain whatever values we want, especially structures.

While this representation is still simplistic, it is just enough of an additional challenge 
because it forces us to formulate a data definition for lists that contain structures:
; Low (short for list of works) is one of: 
; – '()
; – (cons Work Low)
; interpretation an instance of Low represents the 
; hours worked for a number of employees

Here are three elements of Low:
'()
(cons (make-work "Robby" 11.95 39)
      '())
(cons (make-work "Matthew" 12.95 45)
      (cons (make-work "Robby" 11.95 39)
            '()))

10.3 Lists in Lists, Files

Functions and Programs introduces read-file, a function for reading
(Add (require 2htdp/batch-io) to your definitions area. 
an entire text file as a string. In other words, the creator of read-file chose to represent text files 
as strings, and the function creates the data representation for specific files (specified by a name). 
Text files aren’t plain long texts or strings, however. They are organized into lines and words, rows and cells, 
and many other ways. In short, representing the content of a file as a plain string might work on rare occasions 
but is usually a bad choice.

Exercise 176. Mathematics teachers may have introduced you to matrix calculations by now. 
In principle, matrix just means rectangle of numbers. Here is one possible data representation for matrices:
; A Matrix is one of: 
;  – (cons Row '())
;  – (cons Row Matrix)
; constraint all rows in matrix are of the same length
 
; A Row is one of: 
;  – '() 
;  – (cons Number Row)
